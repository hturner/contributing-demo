# How to Make a Contribution to Base R

Script for lightning talk at [Collaboration Workshop 2023](https://software.ac.uk/cw23)

- Good afternoon!
- This lightning talk is essentially an advert for the 'How to Make a Contribution to Base R' demo, which is available on YouTube at the link on the slide, on the SoftwareSaved channel.  
- The R programming language is maintained by the R Core Team. Whilst R has an active user community, and many contributed packages, the process of contributing to base R itself can seem a bit daunting. We hope to demystify this.
- There are several ways to contribute to base R, for example translating R's messages, warnings and errors, and testing pre-release versions.
- Another useful area for community contributions is through analysing and fixing bugs.
- In the video demo, Heather talks through three stages of helping with bugs in R.
- Firstly, how to find bugs using bugzilla, the R bug tracking system, and also what kind of bugs make good first issues.
- Secondly, how to debug R code to find the root of the problem, going through that process with an example bug.
- Thirdly, how to propose a fix, either through comments on bugzilla or by creating a patch via the GitHub mirror of the R source code.
- Finally, the video shares links to the novice-friendly R development guide, the R Contributors Slack group and other R Contributor events, which are useful resources and sources of support as you get started contributing to R.
- So, if you use R and would like to support the project, please do watch the video, join the Slack group and come to our novice-friendly events.
- Also, please do get in touch with us on Slack or via the Mastodon handles on the slide if you'd like to know more.
- Thank you!
